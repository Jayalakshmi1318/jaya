💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection Web Application:

A Machine Learning–based Web Application designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a trained Random Forest classifier.
The application allows users to input transaction details and instantly predicts whether the transaction is legitimate or fraudulent.

🚀 Project Overview:

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of Machine Learning in fraud detection.
It uses a supervised learning model trained on a sample credit card transaction dataset and provides predictions through a simple and user-friendly web interface.
The system helps in identifying suspicious transactions and can be further enhanced for real-world financial security applications.

🧠 Key Features:

✅ Machine Learning–based fraud detection
✅ Random Forest classification model
✅ Flask-based web application
✅ Clean and responsive UI using HTML & CSS
✅ User input for transaction details
✅ Instant fraud prediction
✅ Easy to extend with larger datasets
