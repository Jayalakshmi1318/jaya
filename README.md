Credit Card Fraud Detection Web application

This is a machine learning web application that detects fraudulent credit card transactions.  
Built using Python, Flask, and scikit-learn, it takes user input like transaction ID, card number, and amount, and predicts whether the transaction is fraudulent.  
The model is trained on a sample CSV dataset and uses a Random Forest classifier.  
Frontend is designed with HTML and CSS for a clean user experience.  
To run locally: train the model with 'model.py', then start the app using 'app.py'.  
Visit 'http://127.0.0.1:5000' to test the app in your browser.  
Feel free to expand the dataset and improve the model for better accuracy.
